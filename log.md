### Day 0: July 26, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: command notes:
#disable touchpad command
xinput list
xinput disable 13/14

# inference Mask RCNN
python2 tools/infer_simple.py  --cfg configs/12_2017_baselines/e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN_2x.yaml     --output-dir demo/output/detectron-visualizations  --image-ext jpg --wts weights/model_final.pkl demo

disable the touch pad



**Thoughts:** 
1. use stereo matching to identify the outdoor situation. also can try
2. if the object space occupation in image over threshold, give the single label.
3. if more than 3 types of labels, defining and classify as a scene.
    3.1 count the objects, compare the size of box, calcuthe  all in door, class. 
    3.2 define the scene.
    3.3 interface with

4. how to develop different module and integrate them.
5. try autoML and watch tutorial
